## **Nosleep success factors**


Nosleep is a subreddit where authors share their original horror stories. It exploded in popularity in 2014, growing from 250,000 subscribers to 14,000,000 at the time of writing. 
There have been several authors to have gained real-world success due to their success on /r/nosleep, most notable being the Borrasca writer, The_Dalek_Emperor, who has written for Netflix's The Haunting of Hill Hill House and the The Haunting of Bly Manor.

The aim of this project is to look into which factors contribute to a successful submission on /r/nosleep.


Limitations:
- At the moment, this only goes through the top 1000 posts of /r/nosleep. Needless to say, this isn't a large enough dataset. But the limitation comes from Reddit's own API.
- This only looks into basic factors, such as date and time of submission, and title length.

Future improvements: 
- Use pushshift instead of Reddit's API, thereby circumventing the 1000 post limit, and obtaining all posts from /r/nosleep, which I roughly estimate around 60,000, a significant improvment.
- Look into NLP of the submissions.
